    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>Hello, my name is Andrew.</p>
    <p>
      I've been learning and playing around with various programming languages and platforms since I was fifteen.
      Also thanks to my time in Uni, I can code efficiently, leaving practically no typos behind whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      This way I can focus on finding and building the best solution to any given development goal,
      which I find the most enjoyable part of the process.
      So much so that I sometimes keep building all day long, and still be eager to keep going by nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>I'm now hoping to learn more of the needed tools so I can turn professional a few years from now.</p>
